However a cursor value can be reused to perform retries in case of failures as long as the value has not expired.
    /// </br></br> <h4>Themes </h4> Themes provide additional context for why we are recommending a product as a target. See below for an overall list of themes currently available –  </br><b>- Top converting targets</b> – These ASINs generated conversions for the input ASIN in the past 30 days (e.g. your product appeared as an ad on the detail page of these items, and a shopper clicked and purchased your item). The suggested ASINs under this theme are sorted in decreasing order of sales generated for your promoted item. </br><b>- Similar items (frequently viewed together)</b> – Items that shoppers frequently view and click along with your advertised item during a shopping session.
    /// </br><b>- Complements</b> – Items that are frequently purchased together as complements. For example, if you are promoting a tennis racquet, you may see tennis balls recommended under this theme.
    /// </br><b>- Similar items with low ratings and reviews</b> – Subset of the ‘similar items’ theme containing items that are rated lower than 3 stars and/or with fewer than 5 reviews.
    /// </br><b>- Other books read by your readers</b> – Items that shoppers frequently view and click along with your advertised item during a shopping session. </br></br><i><b>Note:</b> Availability of themes differs by input ASIN - some ASINs may not have all above themes available</i>

This metric helps advertisers identify potential opportunities based on their share on relevant keywords. <b> Search term impression rank </b> indicates your ranking among all advertisers for the keyword by ad impressions in a marketplace. It tells an advertiser how many advertisers had higher share of ad impressions. <i> Search term information is only available for keywords the advertiser targeted with ad impressions. </i> <h3> Availability </h3> Version 4.0 is available in all marketplaces.

Note: value -1 means we don’t have enough information to compute the campaign’s percent time in budget. <br> <b>3.

These are estimates based on historical traffic and the campaign's past performance (e.g. impressions & clicks generated) but not guaranteed.

Please use the recommendationType field to specify if you want to use option A or option B. This endpoint will also return recommended bids along with each recommendation keyword target.<br><br> <b> Ranking </b> <br> The keyword recommendations will be ranked in descending order of clicks or impressions, depending on the <b>sortDimension</b> field provided by the user. You may also input your own keyword targets to be ranked alongside the keyword recommendations by using the <b>targets</b> array. <br><br> <b> Localization </b> <br> Use the <b> locale </b> field to get keywords in your specified locale. Supported marketplace to locale mappings can be found at the <a href='https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/localization/#/Keyword%20Localization'>POST /keywords/localize</a> endpoint. <h1> Version 5.0 </h1>  <h2> New Features </h2> Version 5.0 utilizes the new theme-based bid recommendations, which can be retrieved at the endpoint <b>/sp/targets/bid/recommendations</b>, to return improved bid recommendations for each keyword. Theme-based bid recommendations provide \\\"themes\\\" and \\\"impact metrics\\\" along with each bid suggestion to help you choose the right bid for your keyword target.<br><br><b>Themes</b><br> We now may return multiple bid suggestions for each keyword target. Each suggestion will have a theme to express the business objective of the bid. Available themes are: <ul> <li> CONVERSION_OPPORTUNITIES - The default theme which aims to maximize number of conversions. </li> <li> SPECIAL_DAYS - A theme available during high sales events such as Prime Day, to anticipate an increase in sales and competition.</li></ul><b>Impact Metrics</b><br>We have added impact metrics which provide insight on the number of clicks and conversions you will receive for targeting a keyword at a certain bid. <br><br><b>Bidding Strategy</b><br> You may now specify your bidding strategy in the KEYWORDS_BY_ASINS request to get bid suggestions tailored to your bidding strategy. For KEYWORDS_BY_ADGROUP requests, you will not specify a bidding strategy, because the bidding strategy of the ad group is used. The three bidding strategies are: <ul> <li> LEGACY_FOR_SALES - Dynamic bids (down only) </li> <li> AUTO_FOR_SALES - Dynamic bids (up and down) </li> <li> MANUAL - Fixed bids </li> </ul> <h3> Availability </h3> Version 5.0 is only available in the following marketplaces: US, CA, BR, MX, UK, DE, FR, ES, IN, IT, NL, AE, SA, TR, EG, BE, SE, PL, JP, AU, SG. <h1> Version 4.0 </h1> <h2> New features </h2> Version 4.0 allows users to retrieve recommended keyword targets which are sorted in descending order of clicks or conversions. The default sort dimension, if not specified, ranks recommendations by our interal ranking mechanism. We have also added search term metrics. <b> Search term impression share </b> indicates the percentage share of all ad-attributed impressions you received on that keyword in the last 30 days. This metric helps advertisers identify potential opportunities based on their share on relevant keywords. <b> Search term impression rank </b> indicates your ranking among all advertisers for the keyword by ad impressions in a marketplace. It tells an advertiser how many advertisers had higher share of ad impressions. <i> Search term information is only available for keywords the advertiser targeted with ad impressions. </i> <h3> Availability </h3> Version 4.0 is available in all marketplaces.

    /// Given an advertised ASIN as input, this API returns suggested ASINs to target in a product targeting campaign. We use various methods to generate these suggestions. These include using historical performance of your ad, items that shoppers they frequently view and purchase together, etc. The suggested targets can be retrieved either as a single list, or grouped by ‘theme' – i.e. an accompanying context for why we recommend the items. You can pick the desired format using the Accepts header, please see the response mediaTypes for more information. </br>
    /// <h4>Pagination Behavior</h4> The API supports cursor based pagination using encoded cursor values to return next set of records or previously served records. The <b>count</b> parameter in the request body will be used to determine the size of results when requesting the previous page or next page. If no value for <b>count</b> is passed in the request, a default value is assumed. Please refer the range and defaults for these values in the request schema under GetProductRecommendationsRequest. </br> <i><b>Note:</b> The clients should never cache pagination cursor values locally as these values will expire after a certain time period. However a cursor value can be reused to perform retries in case of failures as long as the value has not expired.
    /// </br></br> <h4>Themes </h4> Themes provide additional context for why we are recommending a product as a target. See below for an overall list of themes currently available –  </br><b>- Top converting targets</b> – These ASINs generated conversions for the input ASIN in the past 30 days (e.g. your product appeared as an ad on the detail page of these items, and a shopper clicked and purchased your item). The suggested ASINs under this theme are sorted in decreasing order of sales generated for your promoted item. </br><b>- Similar items (frequently viewed together)</b> – Items that shoppers frequently view and click along with your advertised item during a shopping session.
    /// </br><b>- Complements</b> – Items that are frequently purchased together as complements. For example, if you are promoting a tennis racquet, you may see tennis balls recommended under this theme.
    /// </br><b>- Similar items with low ratings and reviews</b> – Subset of the ‘similar items’ theme containing items that are rated lower than 3 stars and/or with fewer than 5 reviews.
    /// </br><b>- Other books read by your readers</b> – Items that shoppers frequently view and click along with your advertised item during a shopping session. </br></br><i><b>Note:</b> Availability of themes differs by input ASIN - some ASINs may not have all above themes available</i>
